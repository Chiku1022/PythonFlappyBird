This is a Flappy Bird clone made in Python using the Pygame module.
I had made this game totally without using a computer. I had coded each and everything on my Android phone.

For best experience, run this game on your Android phone!.
1. Install 'Pydroid3' from Google Play Store.
2. Place this complete folder somewhere on your device.
3. Make sure that 'main.py' is on the same location as 'gallery' folder.
4. Open 'Pydroid3' and open 'main.py'.
5. Enjoy!
